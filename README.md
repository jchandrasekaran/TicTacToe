A game engine with 2 agents which can play Tic Tac Toe against each other. The agents could be Naïve or Thoughtful and will take decisions on their moves depending on the rules of the game. The main aim of the project is to think about strategies that an autonomous agent might use in playing a simple game (Tic Tac Toe), and to build a substrate for subsequent projects in which we will explore the use of Knowledge-Based AI techniques for Representation, Reasoning and Learning to improve and expand upon the capabilities of the basic game-playing agents that have been built here.

Once the program TicTacToe.java is run, a console appears that asks to choose one of four options. Select one of the four and hit enter, and the output is displayed.

When executed, the program will give the user four options, all possible combinations of a Naïve and Thoughtful Agent.

Once an option is selected, an instance of a TicTacToe game between those 2 agents will be executed, with step-by-step (or move-by-move) textual output
